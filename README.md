The landing page is finished. The home page is nearly complete. It also uses placeholder text. The website features front and back end capability. The database currently holds the landing page background images for testing purposes.

=== Objectives ===

This is a project considered for future development, where it could have fuller functionality.

Features could include a shop with e-commerce capability, login and sign up for people to review and comment on places they have visited. Also, booking through an external travel and an explore page featuring an interactive map is also considered. 

=== Wireframe ===

Wireframe designs are in place for both the home and explore page. Also for the landing page, but this was revised. The designs can be found in the directory "artboards".
